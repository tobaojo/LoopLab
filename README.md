This is a one page Bootstrap site I created about a fictional social media login site.

It has fixed nav bar with an image with an overlay.
I used flex box to align the text with the icons. 

There a multiple sections that follow a theme to keep things consistent. 

In the footer there is a modal with the 'contact Us' button which fades open and close. 

I also implemented scrollspy so as you scroll the links in the nav bar highlight which i think is a nice touch to bring the site together.
Furthermore, there is a smooth scroll effect so every link in the nav bar takes you to the correct section smoothly. 

The whole site was created with a mobile-first approach so its fully suitable and optimised for all devices. 

I will upload this via netlify for a real demo. (Link will be avaliale as soon as its uploaded.)
